      <p>
        Hi!  I’m Rachel Butler, a botanist turned user experience designer.  I’m
        motivated by the challenge to create products that have a positive
        impact on people’s lives.  With my scientific background, I have
        expertise in research and data analysis and I use data driven solutions
        to build products from conception to hand-off that are intuitive,
        elegant, and inclusive.  I want to join a user experience design team
        where I can use my skills to contribute to products that are a pleasure
        to use.
