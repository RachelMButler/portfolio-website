        <p class="project-details">
          I completed all stages of the user experience design for the mobile
          application ‘Retain’, a flashcard based education tool.  Through
          remote moderated usability testing of the low fidelity prototype of
          the app, I discovered several design flaws that were easy to fix, but
          that made a huge difference to the overall user experience.

        <p class="project-details">
          I completed all stages of the user experience design for ‘Expert’, a
          mobile app that connects users with experts via chat and video call.
          Before putting any design ideas to paper, I conducted extensive
          research, including user research, to ensure that my designs were
          firmly grounded with the user in mind.  To test my initial ideas for
          the app, I conducted user interviews and then used affinity mapping
          to group interviewees answers to gain further insights.

        </div>
      </div>
        <p class="project-details">
          Based on my user research, I then created four user personas,
          representing my target audience.  Using these personas, I mapped out
          mental models and user flows to examine design features and to make
          sure these features were rooted in well researched behaviour of real
          people.

      </div>
        <p class="project-details">
          The results from the user interviews together with mental models and
          user flows really helped me get into the mindset of the user and gave
          me a solid grounding to move forward with the design of Expert.  I
          was then ready to design my information architecture (IA).  I refined
          my IA using the results of open card sorting, which I conducted using
          the online resource OptimalSort.
